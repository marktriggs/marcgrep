What does it do?
----------------

MARCgrep lets you find all the records in a library collection
matching some criteria.  It searches MARC records in the dumbest way
possible: parsing them one at a time and returning any that match.

Input and output are designed to be pluggable, so it should be
possible to extend MARCgrep to read your MARC records from any source
and write them out in whatever format you like.  So far I've got it
reading records from a file or a Lucene index, and writing to either
MARC21 or plain text, but I'd be happy to lend a hand if you have
grand ideas.


How slow is "slow-moving"?
--------------------------

Not as slow as you might think.  By pre-compiling your queries into
fairly efficient Java bytecode and splitting the MARC record parsing
and matching across a couple of CPUs, MARCgrep's na√Øve approach
actually performs pretty well.  Limiting MARCgrep to 4 cores of a 3ghz
Intel Xeon box, I can still check between ten and fifteen-thousand
records per second.


Screenshots

This is all a work in progress, but here's what the user interface
currently looks like:

Building it
-----------

  1.  Get Leiningen from http://github.com/technomancy/leiningen and put
      the 'lein' script somewhere in your $PATH.

  2.  From marcgrep's root directory, run 'lein uberjar'.  Lein will grab
      all required dependencies and produce a 'marcgrep-0.1-standalone.jar'.

  3. Copy config.clj.example to config.clj and edit as appropriate

  4.  Run the jar with, for example:

        java -cp marcgrep-0.1-standalone.jar marcgrep.core

  5.  Point your browser at http://localhost:9095/
